Hi, welcome, and this is a BudgetEat which is a hackathon project that was made to help poverty of not just the homeless people but the regular people nearby.

It is built using React and Django and the main theme of our project was to give them the 
list of prices per grocery stores so the user can select a grocery store with the lowest price.

Although this application is using very old, non dynamic API that our team found browsing through the internet, we believe that this has huge potential growth 
which will be discussed at the end of the video.

First, if we navigate to the ingredient page, we can see a list of grocery items with a price per stores. You can browse through these and see the list of items. 
You also have a search bar where you can search for any of the items if you are looking for a certain item. For example we can search for a apple.

On the right of the item, we have a add button where pressing it will add to the grocery list on the right.
When it is added to the list, you can increase or decrease the amount as you like.

You can add multiple items and when added, the total will be displayed on the bottom of the screen where you can compare to visit the grocery store with the 
lowest price.

This is all we have implemented for now, but in futures, we can also have a features like saving the grocery lists so whenever there is a change in price,
the application can send the message to the user. 

Also, since the targeted user is towards regular people who wishes to save money through grocery, we can have a recipe feature where it includes price 
for the selected recipe.

That is all we have for now, thank you for watching the BudgetEat.
